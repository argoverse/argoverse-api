    "To support our first-ever Stereo Competition on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/917/overview), we have released ground-truth depth for [Argoverse v1.1](https://www.argoverse.org/data.html), derived from lidar point cloud accumulation. We used our recent [scene flow method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00320.pdf) to accumulate lidar points from 11 frames and adopted evaluation metrics from the great [KITTI stereo challenge](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo). However, in comparison to KITTI, our stereo images have 10 times the resolution, and we have 16 times as many training frames — making it a much larger and more robust dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argoverse Stereo consists of rectified stereo images and ground truth disparity maps for 74 out of the 113 Argoverse 3D Tracking Sequences. The stereo images are (2056 x 2464 pixels) and sampled at 5 Hz. The dataset contains a total of 6,624 stereo pairs with ground truth depth, although we withhold the ground truth depth for the 15 sequence test set.\n",

    "Our [EvalAI leaderboard](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/917/leaderboard) ranks all methods according to the number of bad pixels using a threshold of 10 pixels (i.e. **all:10**). Some stereo matching methods such as SGM might provide sparse disparity maps, meaning that some pixels will not have valid disparity values. In those cases, we interpolate the predicted disparity map using a simple nearest neighbor interpolation as in the [KITTI Stereo 2015](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo) benchmark to assure we can compare it to our semi-dense ground-truth disparity map. Current deep stereo matching methods normally predict disparity maps with 100% density. Thus, an interpolation step is not needed for the evaluation.\n",
