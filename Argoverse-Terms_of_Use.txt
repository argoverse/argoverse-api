Terms of Use 
 
Argo AI, LLC, and its affiliates (“Argo”) strive to promote future development in the field of self-driving cars. Using its autonomous vehicles, Argo collected, annotated and organized videos, maps and lidar data in a dataset (the “Argoverse”). By using or downloading the Argoverse, you are agreeing to comply with the terms of this page and any licensing terms referenced below.

Using Argoverse Non-Commercially.  We license Argoverse data and documents for non-commercial use only.  Under the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 “non-commercial” means “not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.” To assist you in determining whether your contemplated use is non-commercial, we make available the following examples:

Example 1, Acceptable Use: 
You are a researcher at an academic institution, working on computer vision and prediction. You use the Argoverse dataset to further your research and publish results based on the Argoverse benchmark. Your published paper includes imagery and figures derived from the Argoverse dataset. The imagery and figures are attributed to Argo and a hyperlink to the text of the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license is provided.

Example 2, Acceptable Use:
You are a researcher at an AV company. You are submitting your image-based pose estimation algorithm to a major conference for public review. You use the Argoverse dataset to train and evaluate your method. You publish the results of the comparison publicly. The Argoverse data in your paper is attributed in accordance with the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Example 3, Unacceptable Use:
You are an engineer at an AV company. You use the Argoverse dataset to train a prototype detection model for use on your company’s AV at a test track. You use this prototype detection model as a placeholder until you build a large enough internal dataset to train your model against.

Example 4, Unacceptable Use:
You are an engineer at a company that produces a robotics platform for sale. You train the prediction and detection machine learning model in your company’s product on data from the Argoverse dataset. Your company releases the product for sale with the model you trained against Argoverse data.

Suggestions:  If you use Argoverse and identify areas that could benefit from changes, we would like to hear from you. Please submit any comments on the issues page of our GitHub repository. If you submit your changes, you may be required to confirm that your changes are subject to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
